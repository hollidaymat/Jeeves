Since no specific files are immediately visible, I'll provide a generic Tailwind-based solution that you can adapt to your specific component.\n\nHere's a recommended approach:\n\n```tsx\n// Example text area component with auto-expanding behavior\nexport function ExpandingTextArea({ \n  value, \n  onChange, \n  placeholder = \"Type your message...\",\n  className = \"\",\n  ...props \n}) {\n  return (\n    <textarea\n      value={value}\n      onChange={onChange}\n      placeholder={placeholder}\n      className={`\n        w-full \n        resize-none  // Prevents manual resizing\n        overflow-hidden  // Hide scrollbar\n        min-h-[50px]  // Minimum height\n        max-h-[200px]  // Maximum height before scrolling\n        p-2 \n        rounded-md \n        border \n        border-gray-300 \n        focus:border-blue-500 \n        focus:ring-1 \n        focus:ring-blue-500\n        ${className}\n      `}\n      style={{\n        height: 'auto',\n        // Use auto-grow technique\n        height: `${Math.max(50, Math.min(200, value.split('\\n').length * 24))}px`\n      }}\n      rows={1}\n      {...props}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\nKey features:\n- Auto-expands vertically\n- Limits max height to prevent infinite growth\n- Prevents horizontal scrolling\n- Maintains a clean, responsive design\n- Uses Tailwind for styling\n- Supports additional className and props\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation or adapt it to a specific framework you're using?",

Interactive Web Actions (Highest Priority)**\n- **What**: Click buttons, fill forms, navigate pages, test user flows\n- **Why**: Transform me from passive observer to active tester\n- **Value**: I could test your DiveConnect booking flow end-to-end, find UX issues, validate forms\n- **ROI**: Catch bugs before users do, automate QA testing\n\n**2. API Testing & Integration**\n- **What**: Make HTTP requests, test endpoints, validate responses\n- **Why**: Most modern development involves APIs\n- **Value**: Test your DiveConnect API, validate data flows, check integrations\n- **ROI**: Faster debugging, automated API validation\n\n**3. Database Query Capability**\n- **What**: Read/write to databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)\n- **Why**: Data is the foundation of most applications\n- **Value**: Debug data issues, run analytics, validate migrations\n- **ROI**: Instant data insights, faster troubleshooting\n\n**4. File System Operations**\n- **What**: Create, edit, move, delete files and directories\n- **Why**: Essential for any real development work\n- **Value**: Manage configs, create scripts, organize projects\n- **ROI**: Actually implement solutions, not just suggest them\n\n**5. Process Management**\n- **What**: Start/stop services, monitor processes, manage background tasks\n- **Why**: DevOps and system administration require this\n- **Value**: Restart failed services, deploy applications, manage your home server\n- **ROI**: Reduce manual intervention, automate maintenance\n\n**My Recommendation**: Start with Interactive Web Actions. It would immediately make me 10x more useful for testing and validating your web applications. The others can follow based on your needs.\n\nWhat resonates most with your current pain points?",
